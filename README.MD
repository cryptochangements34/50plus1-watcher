## This is my first program ever!
It's for educational purpose. I did it to practice with Ruby and APIs, but i want to keep develop it until it reach a decent quality.


`50plus1.rb` is the Ruby file. If you have Ruby installed you can open it typing `ruby 50plus1.rb` in the containing folder
if you haven't Ruby installed use `50plus1.sh` and start it like a normal script: `./50plus1.sh`

### Dependencies
I added some fancy coloration, so the script needs the gem 'term/ansicolor'    
to install it digit `gem install term-ansicolor`

If you have some suggestions/criticism/improvements please open a ticket or make a Pull Request, i would really appreciate it.


If you'd like to support me, a tip for a beer is appreciated!
